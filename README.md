# Hangman

This is my implementation of Hangman game using Typescript. 

I used [Random Words API](https://random-word-api.herokuapp.com/) to get random word.<br>
I've created components:
1. GameScreen => The main window where you can see the hangman himself and the result of the game
2. LettersDisplay => Shows the result of user's attempts to guess the word
3. Keyboard => Simple keyboards which also shows guessed letters


Also you can visit the working version [here](https://melenkooleksandr.github.io/Hangman/)

Maybe this projects will be updated in future with new functionallity like history, users score and so on. 
Have fun!
